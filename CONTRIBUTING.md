# Contributing

This repository is primarily intended as **documentation and demonstration** for an academic project.

However, if you want to suggest improvements:

1. **Open an issue** describing clearly what you want to propose.
2. If you send a pull request:
   - Keep the code and documentation consistent with the current style.
   - Add or update tests when relevant.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a short description of your change.

For changes that affect the Bitcoin Core code itself, please also refer to the
official Bitcoin Core contribution guidelines in the upstream repository.
